How To Use
==========
* *Specific Resources* are meant for APU CSFC members and APU students to get help from.
* The main course curriculum is at `HackNight.md <HackNight.md>`_.
* If you are new and everyone is further ahead of you, do not worry, start from Week 0.
* Follow the curriculum at your own pace.
* If there are hands on for the Week ahead of yours, do not worry, read up on the materials and we will make the concepts as easy as possible for you to understand.

Disclaimers
===========
* The way we run this course may not be as good as how ISIS runs it, but we will try to accommodate the students/members as much as we can.
* This is being done on the APU CSFC curators' own time, resources and knowledge.

Credits

We owe so much to the `ISIS Lab <http://www.isis.poly.edu/>`_ and `Hack Night <http://isislab.github.io/Hack-Night/>`_'s curators for their hard work on the materials.
